# NLP and IR-Projects
Contains all the Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval Projects that I have done

## Notebooks

This folder contains all the python notebooks, with the implementation of the projects, that I have done. It contains hierarchy of sub-folders, each containing a specific project with all its resources. 

To view a particular project, please open the folder and view the notebook file. If you wish to run the project, kindly download the entire folder and run the project with all its resources kept in the same folder.

### Projects:

1. Analyzing Bigrams - This project utilizes the concept of bigrams and adds them to the vocabulary. Finally, it creates a TF-IDF matrix and based on the frequency of words, it generates word-cloud across the years in the dataset.

2. Comparison of Different Models of Naive Bayes - This project compares the different models of Naive Bayes namely Bernoulli, Multinomial and Complement Naive Bayes. It sees how they perform on a particular dataset and which one is better.

3. Comparison of LinearSVC with DummyClassifier - This project compares two classifiers for text processing with each other, to see which is better.

4. Comparison of Multinomial NB with Linear SVC - This project compares the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with Linear SVC, given different combinations of parameters.

5. Finding Similar Headlines - This project simulates the concept of finding related documents given a word or an article by it's headlines. It finds similarity between documents using cosine similarity and then displays similar documents or words.

6. Frequency of Keywords in Debates over time - This project finds the frequency of a key term in documents over the years. 

7. Percentage of Support Vectors - This project simulates fitting a support vector classification model on a set of documents and attempts to find the percentage of support vectors present in the data.

8. Porter Stemmer - This project depicts the use of porter stemmer used in data pre-processing, in cases of NLP and IR.

9. Selecting Tweets with particular words - This project shows how we can find a trend for a particular word amongst tweets.

10. Tokenizers for Tweets - This projects showcases the different types of tokenizers that we can use to tokenize text in tweets.

11. Word Frequency Analysis - This project depicts how we can use wordcloud to find out the frequency of tokens found.
